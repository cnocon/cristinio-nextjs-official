## Table of Contents

Over the course of my fifteen year career working with web applications and software, I've encountered countless courses, articles, podcasts, and books that tout themselves as high quality resources. Looking back through the years, I think finding the best resources to grow as a frontend engineer will depend on where you're at in your career.

### WCAG 2.2 + WAI “What's new” (free, standards)

If you want to be the engineer who makes accessibility real (and defensible), go to the source.

### Playwright Docs

Most teams need reliable E2E; Playwright's docs are unusually clear and production-oriented.

### RTL

Teaches the right mental model for UI testing (test behavior, not implementation).

### TypeScript Handbook

If you work in TS daily, this is the reference that actually matches the language and idioms (especially “Handbook” section).

### web.dev “Learn” courses - Performance, Accessibility, Core Web Vitals

Modern, practical, and grounded in how browsers + real user metrics work. Great for “I want to ship faster, more accessible sites.”

### MDN Curriculum + “Learn web development” modules

The best structured “fill the gaps” foundation for professional FE work (HTML/CSS/JS + tooling + deployment basics).

### fireship.dev

### Treehouse

### Educative

### CodePen

### CSS-Tricks

### ChatGPT Plus

### Pluralsight Skills

### Frontend Masters

Best “one subscription” option for going from mid → senior across JS, TS, React, architecture, performance, etc., with structured paths.

### Smashing Magazine

## Best books

1. Refactoring UI (design taste for engineers; immediately improves shipped UI)
2. Design Systems (Alla Kholmatova) (how to scale UI consistency across teams)
3. CSS Secrets (Lea Verou) (level-up CSS problem solving)
4. High Performance Browser Networking (Ilya Grigorik) (deep performance + networking intuition)
